# Fractal Geometry of Polaris

An application of Beattie et al. (2019) method on Polaris Herschel data.

The two FITS files are the so-called saxophone and quiet regions in Polaris. This code runs
the fractal dimension code from Beattie et al. (2019) on these regions, constructing mass-length fractal dimension curves. We extract the fractal dimension at the cloud scale and use this to measure the turbulent Mach number of the clouds. The turbulent Mach number has applications in filament theory, star formation modelling and parameterises the 3D density distribution.

More documentation will be added in time.
